# 🌐 Customer Feedback Sentiment Analysis
The script essentially demonstrates how to perform sentiment analysis on data using spaCy and TextBlob, as well as how to calculate similarity between two pieces of text. However, please note that this script assumes the existence of a CSV file named 'amazon_product_reviews.csv' in the same directory as the script itself, containing a column named 'reviews.text' which holds the reviews to be analyzed. Additionally, you need to have spaCy and the SpacyTextBlob library installed in your Python environment to run this code.

## 📈Features
- This Python script analyzes the sentiment of customer feedback using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. 
- It provides insights into the emotional tone of the feedback, helping businesses understand customer sentiment more effectively
- It classifies feedback as positive, negative, or neutral based on sentiment analysis.
